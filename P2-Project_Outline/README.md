# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My app will essentially just be a forum, similar to facebook or stack overflow. 
### Features
1) Login: User registration and login, allowing users to create a new account as long as an account using their email doesn't already exist.
2) Profile Picture: The ability to upload a profile picture, which will be displayed along with all of the user's posts on their profile page.
3) Posts: The ability to make text posts, which will be accompanied by a timestamp, user signature which links to the author's profile, and the total number of comments on the post.
4) Comments: The ability to comment on posts; like posts, comments will also be accompanied by a timestamp and clickable signature.
5) Messages: The ability to send direct messages to other users; users will have an "inbox" area for recieved messages as well as a "sent" area for sent messages.
6) Search: The ability to search through posts and users at any point from the navigation bar.
7) Design: Basic responsive design.
### Technologies
Java, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap and (maybe) Javascript.
### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll have to learn how to create sessions and upload image files with my chosen technologies. I'll also have to learn to use Bootstrap in order to create a responsive navigation bar with embedded search. I may also need to learn a little Javascript in order to implement pop-up post/message delete confirmation.
